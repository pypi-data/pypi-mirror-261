# TechBeamers Code Analyzer

The TechBeamers Code Analyzer is a Python tool for analyzing Python code using PEP 8, Flake8, and MyPy. It generates comprehensive reports on code style, potential issues, and type checking.

## Features

This code analyzer combines the power of the latest and top three code analysis tools. It performs a three-level analysis on the provided file, aiming to identify potential issues within your code.

- PEP 8 analysis for ensuring Python code adheres to the style guide.
- Flake8 analysis for checking code against coding standards and identifying potential issues.
- MyPy analysis for performing static type checking and highlighting type-related errors.

## Installation

You can install the TechBeamers Code Analyzer using pip:

```bash
pip install techbeamers
```

## Usage

To analyze a Python file, run the following command:

```bash
techbeamers-analyzer path/to/your/file.py
```
The above command will, by default, detect the programming language based on the file extension and provide you with a brief statistics summary of the specified file. To perform code analysis, ensure to provide any or a combination of the command-line options, as shown in the next section.

### Options

- `--report-format`: Format for saving detailed reports, such as html (default) or txt..
- `--analyze-pep8`: Perform PEP 8 analysis using pycodestyle.
- `--analyze-flake8`: Perform Flake8 analysis.
- `--analyze-mypy`: Perform MyPy analysis.
- `--disable-all`: Disable all analyses.
- `--help`: Display available options.

### Examples

```bash
# Analyze a Python file for PEP8 and generate an HTML report
techbeamers-analyzer path/to/your/file.py --analyze-pep8 --report-format html

# Analyze a Python file using Flake8 and generate a text report
techbeamers-analyzer path/to/your/file.py --analyze-flake8 --report-format txt

# Analyze a Python file using mypy and generate default html report
techbeamers-analyzer path/to/your/file.py --analyze-mypy

# Analyze a Python file with both PEP8 and Flake8 but without mypy
techbeamers-analyzer path/to/your/file.py --analyze-pep8 --analyze-flake8

# Run all three analysis on your Python file
techbeamers-analyzer path/to/your/file.py --analyze-pep8 --analyze-flake8 --analyze-mypy
```

## Reports

Detailed reports are generated in both HTML and TXT formats, providing insights into code quality and potential improvements. The tool saves the reports in the same folder as the target file specified for analysis.

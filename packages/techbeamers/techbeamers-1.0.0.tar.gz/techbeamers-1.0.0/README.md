# TechBeamers Code Analyzer

The TechBeamers Code Analyzer is a Python tool for analyzing Python code using PEP 8, Flake8, and MyPy. It provides a comprehensive report on code style, potential issues, and type checking.

## Features

- PEP 8 analysis for ensuring Python code adheres to the style guide.

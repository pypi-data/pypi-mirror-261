# `deptool`

`deptool` provides developers with an generic and configurable way to install their projects' dependencies. Users
specify their project's dependencies in a manifest file, and `deptool` installs those dependencies using scripts
located in registries.

[Dev Container Features](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/) is the primary inspiration for this tool with
additional influences from [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/), [APT](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt), and
[rosdep](https://docs.ros.org/en/independent/api/rosdep/html/).

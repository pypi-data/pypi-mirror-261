# Wave Monitor

A simple GUI for monitoring waveforms. It plots waveforms with PyQtGraph in a separate process. The GUI is built with PySide6.

The `WaveMonitor` class is the main interface. It provides methods for adding and removing waveforms from the plot, clearing the plot, and etc.

In GUI, right click to show the menu. Keyboard shortcuts are also supported.

# Installation

```bash
pip install wave-monitor
```

or install from source.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Qiujv/WaveMonitor.git
```

# Usage
Avoid calling `clear` if you only want to update the plot. It is more efficient to update the plot with `add_wfm`.

```python
from wave_monitor import WaveMonitor
import numpy as np

monitor = WaveMonitor()
monitor.find_or_run_monitor_window()
monitor.autoscale()
# monitor.clear()

t = np.linspace(0, 1, 1_000_001)  # 1m pts ~= 1ms for 1GSa/s.
n = 20  # Okay with 20.
i_waves = [np.cos(2 * np.pi * f * t) for f in range(1, n + 1)]
q_waves = [np.sin(2 * np.pi * f * t) for f in range(1, n + 1)]

for i, (i_wave, q_wave) in enumerate(zip(i_waves, q_waves)):
    monitor.add_wfm(f"wave_{i%15}", t, [i_wave, q_wave])
monitor.autoscale()

monitor.remove_wfm("wave_10")

```

# Notes

Seems distribute the package with an icon file is mission impossible.
If you want, download the icon.png here and place it in there you find the `wave_monitor.py` file could work.
The icon is from https://www.freepik.com/icons/oscilloscope and made by piksart.

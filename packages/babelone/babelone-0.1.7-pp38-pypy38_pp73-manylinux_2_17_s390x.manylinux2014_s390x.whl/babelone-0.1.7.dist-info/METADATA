# babelone

> pronounced /ˌbæbɪˈloʊn/

## Wait, babe-what?

It's a Python CLI, built in Rust, that can convert between requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml as well as scaffold one of such files to get your project started.

babelone was built to help you sort out all your package build spec files, because—let's face it—it can sometimes be a pain in the you-know-what.

## Python CLI Built in Rust?

There's not a whole lot of Python, but it is the layer that allows you to `pip install` with ease and talk to a friendly CLI (thanks to the folks at [rich-click](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click)).

The rest is indeed in Rust; and if that's still making your head itch, I recommend taking a look at these revolutionary projects:
-  [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)
-  [RustPython](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython)

## Installation

```bash
pip install babelone
```

## Usage

```bash
babelone --help

# Option 1: Scaffold a build spec.
babelone create <path>/[requirements.txt|setup.py|pyproject.toml]

# Option 2: Translate between build specs.
babelone translate <path>/[requirements.txt|setup.py|pyproject.toml] <path>/[requirements.txt|setup.py|pyproject.toml]
```

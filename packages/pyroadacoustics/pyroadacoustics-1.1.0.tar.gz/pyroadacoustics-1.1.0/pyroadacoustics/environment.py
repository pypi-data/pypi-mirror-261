class Environment:
    """
    This is the main class of the package and defines the Acoustic Scene that will be simulated. The goal of the
    package is the simulation of a moving sound source emitting sound above a flat surface. The sound propagation
    is simulated according to a model of the atmospheric sound propagation, and takes into account the sound
    that is being reflected by the road surface.

    The acoustic scene is composed of:
    * One sound source, emitting an arbitrary signal. It can be static or move along an arbitrary trajectory
    * One Microphone Array, containing a set of N omnidirectional microphones with an arbitrary disposition. The 
    array is static and is used to capture the sound produced by the moving source.
    * A set of environmental parameters describing the atmospheric conditions:
            * Atmospheric Pressure
            * Atmospheric Temperature
            * Relative Humidity
    * The material of the road surface
    * An optional diffuse background noise signal to be added to the simulation

    Alongside these parameters, simulation attributes are also defined:
    * The sampling frequency
    * The air absorption coefficients
    * The asphalt reflection coefficients or flow resistance

    From this class the simulation can be set up and run, via the instantiation of a SimulatorManager that
    contains the core functions of the simulator.

        * The possibility to include the reflected sound path in the simulation. If it is not included, the source is
        assumed to emit sound in the free-field and just the direct path is simulated: this reduces the computational
        load but also the physical accuracy

        instant, and implies an increase of the computational complexity. This can be neglected, leading to a reduction in the

        include_air_absorption : bool
            Bool, if `True` (default), the air absorption is included in the simulation. The air absorption is modeled 
            using a FIR filter with 11 taps, whose coefficients depend on the distance between source and receiver

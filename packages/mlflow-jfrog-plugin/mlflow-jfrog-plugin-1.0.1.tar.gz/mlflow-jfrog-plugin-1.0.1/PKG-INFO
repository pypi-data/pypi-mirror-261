JFrog MLFlow plugin is a plugin created by JFrog for customers using MLflow product. MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. The JFrog MLflow plugin extends MLflow functionality by replacing the default artifacts location of MLflow with JFrog Artifactory. Once MLflow experiments artifacts are available inside JFrog Artifactory, they become an integral part of the company's release lifecycle as any other artifact and are also covered by all the security tools provided through the JFrog platform.

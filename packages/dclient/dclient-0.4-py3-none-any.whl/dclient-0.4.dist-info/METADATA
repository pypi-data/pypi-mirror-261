A client CLI utility for [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) instances.

Much of the functionality requires Datasette 1.0a2 or higher.

## Things you can do with dclient

- Run SQL queries against Datasette and returning the results as JSON
- Run queries against authenticated Datasette instances
- Create aliases and store authentication tokens for convenient access to Datasette
- Insert data into Datasette using the [insert API](https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/json_api.html#the-json-write-api) (Datasette 1.0 alpha or higher)

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:
```bash
pip install dclient
```
If you want to install it in the same virtual environment as Datasette (to use it as a plugin) you can instead run:
```bash
datasette install dclient
```
## Running a query

```bash
dclient query https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures "select * from facetable limit 1"
```
To shorten that, create an alias:
```bash
dclient alias add fixtures https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures
```
Then run it like this instead:
```bash
dclient query fixtures "select * from facetable limit 1"
```
## Documentation

Visit **[dclient.datasette.io](https://dclient.datasette.io)** for full documentation on using this tool.

## Development

To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
```bash
cd dclient
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e '.[test]'
```
To run the tests:
```bash
pytest
```

## News
We are thrilled to announce the official release of CoastSeg version 1.0.0! Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/Doodleverse/CoastSeg/releases/tag/v1.0.0). If you are an existing CoastSeg user, to upgrade to this latest version of CoastSeg:

```
git pull origin main
```

then: 
```
pip install coastseg==1.0.0
```

## What is CoastSeg?

Coastseg stands for Coastal Segmentation, it is an interactive jupyter notebook for downloading satellite imagery with [CoastSat](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) and applying Doodleverse/[Zoo](https://github.com/Doodleverse/segmentation_zoo) image segmentation models to satellite imagery. CoastSeg provides an interactive interface for drawing Regions of Interest (ROIs) on a map, downloading satellite imagery, loading geojson files, extracting shorelines from satellite imagery, and much more. In a nutshell, it is ...

- ... an easy way to download time-series of cloud-masked and post-processed satellite imagery anywhere in the world
- ... a mapping extension for [CoastSat](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) using [Segmentation Zoo](https://github.com/Doodleverse/segmentation_zoo) models.
- ... an interactive interface to download satellite imagery using CoastSat from Google Earth Engine
- ... an interactive interface for extracting shorelines from satellite imagery
- ... an interactive interface to apply segmentation models to satellite imagery

In more detail, CoastSeg represents the following advances in satellite-derived shoreline workflows:

1. An emulation of the CoastSat methodology for defining a shoreline extraction project, image downloading, shoreline extraction, shoreline filtering, and tide correction, all within a single jupyter notebook that can be accessed online
2. A pip-installable package for CoastSat workflows
3. Use of concurrency for image downloads from Google Earth Engine
4. A faster and more convenient API-based methodology for tidal height estimation, using pyTMD
5. An initial implementation of an alternative shoreline mapping workflow using Zoo models from the Doodleverse
6. A conda environment that can work on secure networks
7. Script-based data wrangling utilities
8. Hyperparameter experimentation and tracking using an organizational workflow idea called ‘Sessions’
9. Supporting databases for transects, reference shorelines, beach slopes, and other useful metadata variables
10. A deep-learning based shoreline extraction workflow (still in development)

Version 1 is now stable, and we have a lot of planned new features for version 2.

- Create ROIs(regions of interest) along the coast and automatically load shorelines on the map.
- Use Google Earth Engine to automatically download satellite imagery for each ROI clicked on the map.

## Installation Instructions

We recommend that you use Windows 10, Windows 11, or Ubuntu Linux. Mac users, please see [here](https://github.com/Doodleverse/CoastSeg/wiki/01.-How-to-Install-CoastSeg#mac-users)

In order to use Coastseg you need to install Python packages in an environment. We recommend you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) to install the python packages in an environment for Coastseg. 

After you install miniconda/Anaconda on your PC, open the Anaconda prompt or Terminal in Mac and Linux and use the `cd` command (change directory) to go the folder where you have downloaded the Coastseg repository.
## Install from conda-forge
1. Create an miniconda/Anaconda environment and Activate it
- This command creates an anaconda environment named `coastseg` and installs `python 3.10` in it.
  ```bash
  conda create --name coastseg python=3.10 -y
  conda activate coastseg
  ```

2. Install coastseg 

   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge coastseg==1.1.41
   ```
3. (Optional) Install Optional Dependencies
    - Only install these dependencies if you plan to use CoastSeg's zoo workflow notebook. 
    ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install transformers
   ```  

## Install from Pypi
1. Create an miniconda/Anaconda environment
- This command creates an anaconda environment named `coastseg` and installs `python 3.10` in it.
  ```bash
  conda create --name coastseg python=3.10 -y
  ```

2. Activate your conda environment

   ```bash
   conda activate coastseg
   ```

- If you have successfully activated coastseg you should see that your terminal's command line prompt should now start with `(coastseg)`.

     alt="coastseg activated in anaconda prompt" width="350" height="150">

3. Install Conda Dependencies
   - CoastSeg requires `jupyterlab` and `geopandas` to function properly so they will be installed in the `coastseg` environment.
   - [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) has [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) as a dependency so its best to install it with conda.
   - Make sure to install geopandas from the `conda-forge` channel to ensure you get the latest version.
   - Make sure to install both jupyterlab and geopandas from the conda forge channel to avoid dependency conflicts
     ```bash
     conda install -c conda-forge geopandas -y
     ```
4. Install the CoastSeg from PyPi
   ```bash
   pip install coastseg
   ```
5. Uninstall the h5py installed by pip and reinstall with conda-forge
   - `pip install jsonschema==4.19.0` is a temporary command you have to run until issue https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/issues/1214 is resolved
   ```bash
   pip install jsonschema==4.19.0 --user  
   pip uninstall h5py -y
   conda install -c conda-forge h5py -y
   ```

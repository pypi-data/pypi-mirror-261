        Returns the Timeline of acceptable (good) ACC quality.
        ACC quality is a dubious concept, quite different from what is noise in electrophysiology signals.
        The concept of motion artifact does not exist, nonetheless, we know that human motion is usually between
        0 Hz (at rest) and 20 Hz (vigorous movement). And 98% of the FFT amplitude is contained below 10 Hz.
        Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3859040/

        Hence, everything outside the 0-20 Hz range will be considered noise:
        - High-frequency Gaussian Noise, f > 20 Hz, e.g. 50 Hz power line noise, natural tremors, etc.
            * HFN < 2% is considered acceptable.
        - Low-frequency Artifacts, f < 0.05 Hz, e.g. DC offset, baseline wander (on chest), etc.
            This can be ignored since most ACC for human motion recording are low g-range (1-3 g).

## Getting Started

#### Installing the Package

This framework was developed and tested on Python 3.10.4, so make sure you have an interperter >= 3.10.4.

If you are familired with pip, you can download and install the package by running:

```
pip install LongTermBiosignals
```

If not, you may download the latest stable GitHub release [here](https://github.com/jomy-kk/IT-LongTermBiosignals/releases) and place a copy of the `ltbio` directory (which is inside `src`) on your project's root.

#### Dependencies

See Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

You may consider installing the following on your machine if needed:
* `graphviz` to plot Pipeline diagrams (`sudo apt-get install graphviz` or `brew install graphviz`)
* `h5py` to read HDF5 files if running on an Apple Sillicon machine (`brew install hdf5 && export HDF5_DIR=/opt/homebrew/bin/brew/Cellar/hdf5/<version>`)

#### Simple Use Case

Let's create a sequence of samples using `Timeseries`:

```
from ltbio.biosignals import Timeseries

ts = Timeseries([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], initial_datetime = datetime.datetime.now(), sampling_frequency = 360.0)
```

Add let's pretend this was a 1-lead ECG ðŸ«€:

```
from ltbio.biosignals.modalities import ECG
 
my_ecg = ECG({'Left': ts})
```

Simple, right? There's loads of more stuff to customize like sources, body locations, physical units, events, etc. Explore it in this [notebook](https://github.com/jomy-kk/IT-LongTermBiosignals/blob/main/examples/getting_started.ipynb) ðŸ““ and in the <a href="https://github.com/jomy-kk/IT-LongTermBiosignals/wiki">Wiki</a>.

Implementation of standard `TaskProcessor` implementations of the [magnum-opus](https://github.com/nicc777/magnum-opus) library.


# Development Quick Start

Preparing your local system for development:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv

. venv/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Also install the latest version of [magnum-opus](https://github.com/nicc777/magnum-opus). For now, assuming you have cloned and build `opus` locally, install the `opus` library from the package in the `dist/` directory from the project directory. An example:

```shell
pip3 install $HOME/git/magnum-opus/dist/magnum_opus-1.tar.gz
```

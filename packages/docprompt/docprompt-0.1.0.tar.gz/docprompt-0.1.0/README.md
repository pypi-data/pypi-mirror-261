# Docprompt

Docprompt is a library for working with text-rich multimodal inputs to support Large Language Model Workloads

This library has several goals

* Abstractions for document operations with third party providers

* Functionality for robust conversion of OCR'd documents into inputs suitable for large language models

* State of the art document masking with text synthesis

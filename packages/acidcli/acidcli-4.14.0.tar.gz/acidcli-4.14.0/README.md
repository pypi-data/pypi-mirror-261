acidcli stands for Accelerated Continuous Integration & Delivery Command Line
Interface and is a command-line application that helps to implement and
integrate ACID-compliant pipelines. It is effectively a Swiss Army knife for
everything related to ACID.

The acidcli has a uniform way of interfacing with projects, enforcing steps and

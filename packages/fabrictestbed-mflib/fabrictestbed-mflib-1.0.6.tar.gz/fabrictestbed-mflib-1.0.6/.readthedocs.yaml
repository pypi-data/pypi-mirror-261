# readthedocs.org uses Python 3.7 by default; mflib has to use Python
# 3.9 or greater.  This incantation seems to work.
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.9"

# Tell RTD location of our Sphinx configuration.  Seems to work
# without this too, although default is docs/conf.py.
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/source/conf.py

# We need to install some Python packages to build API docs.
python:
  install:

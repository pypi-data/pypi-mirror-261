# Masoud

> *Masoud (Arabic: مسعود يُقرأ:مَس عُود, lit. 'fortune, happy, prosperous, lucky'*

Masoud is a Python library that helps me manage complex multi-host container setups in a flexible and declarative way.

Masoud is built on the following concepts:

1. *Inventories* (host connection information, host variables) are stored in TOML 
2. *Services* (Nginx, Postgres, your own `Dockerfile`, ...) are described in Python

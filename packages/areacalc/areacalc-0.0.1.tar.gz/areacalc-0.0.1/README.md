The module allows you to easily get areas of your 2D figures using only some of their parameters.

### Using ### 

Using the library is very simple.

For example, you want to calculate area of triangle. All you need is length of each side:
    
    print(Area.triangle_sides(3, 4, 5))

will output:

    Triangle is rectangular!
    6.0

And so on. For all specifications that methods needs you can type:
    
    help(Area)

Or if you want exact function, for example
    
    polygon_dots()

you can check documentation with __doc__ method

    Area.polygon_dots().__doc__

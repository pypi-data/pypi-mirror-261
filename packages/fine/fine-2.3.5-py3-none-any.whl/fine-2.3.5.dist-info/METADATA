# ETHOS.FINE - Framework for Integrated Energy System Assessment


The ETHOS.FINE python package provides a framework for modeling, optimizing and assessing energy systems. With the provided framework, systems with multiple regions, commodities and time steps can be modeled. Target of the optimization is the minimization of the total annual cost while considering technical and environmental constraints. Besides using the full temporal resolution, an interconnected typical period storage formulation can be applied, that reduces the complexity and computational time of the model.

This readme provides information on the installation of the package. For further information have a look at the [documentation](https://vsa-fine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

ETHOS.FINE is used for the modelling of a diverse group of optimization problems within the [Energy Transformation PatHway Optimization Suite (ETHOS) at IEK-3](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/iek/iek-3/leistungen/model-services).  

If you want to use ETHOS.FINE in a published work, please [**kindly cite following publication**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421830879X) which gives a description of the first stages of the framework. The python package which provides the time series aggregation module and its corresponding literature can be found [here](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/tsam).

## Requirements

### Python package manager
The installation process uses a Conda-based Python package manager. We highly recommend using [(Micro-)Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead of Conda. The recommended way to use Mamba on your system is to install the [Miniforge distribution](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#miniforge3). They offer installers for Windows, Linux and OS X. In principle, Conda and Mamba are interchangeable. The commands and concepts are the same. The distributions differ in the methodology for determining dependencies when installing Python packages. Mamba relies on a more modern methodology, which (with the same result) leads to very significant time savings during the installation of FINE. Switching to Mamba usually does not lead to any problems, as it is virtually identical to Conda in terms of operation.

If you decide to use Conda you have to expect longer installation times for FINE. In this case, we recommend the installation [through our conda-forge package](#installation-via-conda-forge).

### Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver
The project environment includes [GLPK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winglpk/files/latest/download) as Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver. If you want to solve large problems it is highly recommended to install [GUROBI](http://www.gurobi.com/). See ["Installation of an optimization solver"](#installation-of-an-optimization-solver) for more information.

## Installation

If you would like to run FINE for your analysis we recommend to install it directly from conda-forge into a new Python environment. Alternatively you can install it from a local folder by using the `requirements.yml` file. If you want to work on the FINE code base choose "Installation for developers". It performs an editable installation of FINE and add some developer tools (e.g. pytest, black) to the environment.

###  Installation via conda-forge
The simplest way ist to install FINE into a fresh environment from `conda-forge` with:
```bash
mamba create -n fine -c conda-forge fine
```

### Installation from a local folder
Alternatively you can first clone the content of this repository and perform the installation from there: 

1. (Shallow) clone the content of this repository 
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE.git 
```
2. Move into the FINE folder with
```bash
cd fine
```
3. It is recommended to create a clean environment with conda to use FINE because it requires many dependencies. 
```bash
mamba env create -f requirements.yml
```
5. Activate the new environment. You should see `(fine)` in front of your command prompt to indicate that you are now in the virtual environment.
```bash
mamba activate fine
```
6. Install FINE with:
```bash
python -m pip install --no-deps .
```

### Installation for developers
If you want to work on the FINE codebase you need to run. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE.git
```
to get the whole git history and then
```bash
mamba env create -f requirements_dev.yml
```
This installs additional dependencies such as `pytest` and installs FINE from the folder in editable mode with `pip -e`. Changes in the folder are then reflected in the package installation.
Finally, install FINE in editable mode with:
```bash
python -m pip install --no-deps --editable .
```
Test your installation with the following command in the project root folder:
```
pytest
```

## Installation of an optimization solver

FINE requires an MILP solver which can be accessed using [PYOMO](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). It searches for the following solvers in this order:
- [GUROBI](http://www.gurobi.com/)
   - Recommended due to better performance but requires license (free academic version available)
   - Set as standard solver
- [GLPK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winglpk/files/latest/download)
  - This solver is installed with the FINE environment.
  - Free version available 
- [CBC](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc)
  - Free version available

### Gurobi installation
The installation requires the following three components:
- Gurobi Optimizer
    - In order to [download](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer-eula/) the software you need to create an account and obtain a license.
- Gurobi license
    - The license needs to be installed according to the instructions in the registration process.
- Gurobi python api
    - The python api can be installed according to [this instruction](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044290292-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-Python-).

### GLPK installation
A complete installation instruction for Windows can be found [here](http://winglpk.sourceforge.net/).

### CBC
Installation procedure can be found [here](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc).

We are the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/iek/iek-3">Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-economic Systems Analysis (IEK-3)</a> belonging to the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>. Our interdisciplinary department's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.

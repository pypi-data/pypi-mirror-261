Stream Zip Downloader
=====================

Description
-----------
Many times, we don't need all the content of a zip file, or the disk space is limited and there isn't enough space to decompress a downloaded compressed file. In these cases, the feature of streaming download and decompression can disrupt this process. This repository allows for the streaming download and decompression of zip files without the need for full download and decompression, saving both time and disk space.

This tool has been tested with large files, such as a ~69.7G compressed file from Genshin Impact, which can be downloaded and decompressed through streaming in about 22 minutes.

Warning
-------
Although this repository is now ready for direct use and has been tested with significant file sizes, unexpected bugs may occur. It is not recommended to use this tool in a production environment without further testing. Use at your own risk.

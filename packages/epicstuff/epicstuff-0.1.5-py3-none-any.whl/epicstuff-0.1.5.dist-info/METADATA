a few somewhat useful python objects

## TODO:

-   [ ] when doing bar in bar with the second bar being transient, make so that the dots continue from where the previous bar left off
-   [ ] implement auto transient for bar in bar
-   [ ] add and implement simple=False for .Bar.track()

## Stuff:

-   Note to self:
    -   "self install" using `pip install -U -e .`

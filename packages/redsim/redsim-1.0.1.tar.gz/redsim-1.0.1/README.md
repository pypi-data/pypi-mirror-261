# Redstone Gas Management Project

This repository contains all the code and analysis related to the Redstone Gas Management Project.

Redstone is an Optimistic Rollup built on the OP Stack by Lattice. It aims to be a highly efficient and cost-effective rollup for on-chain games and other heavy applications. This project focuses on modeling the costs of running the Redstone mainnet and stress-testing the operationâ€™s sustainability.

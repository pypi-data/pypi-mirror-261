           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# Calais

### Command Line AI for fast, easy commands.

`Calais` speeds your interaction in terminal shells by commands for you using
`GPT-4`. So
 * You write natural language requests instead of commands.
 * You don't have to remember which commands to use.
 * You don't have to remember command syntax. 
 * You can execute almost as fast as you can type what you want.
 * You can learn Linux shell commands by watching best-practice examples.

### Features
 * For safety, it shows you the command before running it so you can confirm it.
   [Always review the command before running it. See 
   [Safeties and Cautions](#safeties-and-cautions).]
 * You can ask it to explain the command it returns.
 * It will ask for needed parameters.
 * You can chat with GPT-4 in addition to generating commands.
 * The command is `ai` for simplicity and speed.
 * It assumes common command line utilities so casual language will usually
   return the right result.


### Examples

```
$ ai list uncommitted files
Command: `git status --porcelain`
[r]un,(e)xplain],(q)uit, or continue chatting:             # <-- [Hit enter]
 M README.md
MM chat.py
MM client.py
AM content_printer.py
...
```
Note that you didn't have to even specify `git`. It assumes common utilities so
you can use casual language and GPT-4 understands what you intend. You can
specify what you need if necessary.

It provides a speedup over looking up arcane command syntax:

```
$ ai update current commit without writing
Command: `git commit --amend --no-edit`
[r]un,(e)xplain],(q)uit, or continue chatting:             # <-- [Hit enter]
```

The commands can be as sophisticated as you can describe and GPT-4 can generate:

```
$ ai list Python files by size then search the top 3 for the word api
Command: `find . -name '*.py' -exec ls -lS {} + | head -3 | awk '{print $9}' | xargs grep -l 'api'`
[r]un,(e)xplain],(q)uit, or continue chatting:             # <-- [Hit enter]
./tests/test_chat.py
./chat.py
```

I even find that it's faster to use `Calais` for simple commands that I already
know because it's faster to type without correct syntax.

```
$ ai echo path
The command is: `echo $PATH`
Run [Y/n/(e)xplain] `echo $PATH`:      # <-- [Hit enter]
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/pyenv/2.3.36/plugins/python-build/bin:/usr/local/Caskroom/...
```
### Argument Request

If you ask for a command that needs more information, `Calais` will ask for it
and use it to complete the command:

```
$ ai add and commit files
Enter the value for <message>: added JSON response parsing from OpenAI API
Command: `git add . && git commit -m 'added JSON response parsing from OpenAI API'`
[r]un,(e)xplain],(q)uit, or continue chatting:
```


### Explain

You can ask `Calais` to explain the command it generated:

```
$ ai list Python files by size then search the top 3 for the word api
Command: `find . -name '*.py' -exec ls -lS {} + | head -n 3 | awk '{print $9}' | xargs grep -l 'api'`
[r]un,(e)xplain],(q)uit, or continue chatting: e
This command performs several actions in sequence to find Python files
containing the word 'api'. Here's a breakdown: 1. `find . -name '*.py'` searches
the current directory and subdirectories for files ending in '.py'. 2. `-exec ls
-lS {} +` executes `ls -lS` on the found files, listing them in long format
sorted by size in descending order. 3. `head -n 3` takes the top 3 of these
files (the largest ones). 4. `awk '{print $9}'` extracts the 9th field from the
output, which corresponds to the filenames. 5. `xargs grep -l 'api'` uses `grep
-l` to search for the word 'api' in these files, listing only the filenames that
contain the match.
Command: `find . -name '*.py' -exec ls -lS {} + | head -n 3 | awk '{print $9}' | xargs grep -l 'api'`
[r]un,(e)xplain],(q)uit, or continue chatting:
```


## Chatting with GPT-4
You can also use `Calais` to chat with GPT-4:

Here, we ask for some Old English then ask for a translation:

```text
$ ai write out the first 4 lines of the canterbury tales
Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote,
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,
And bathed every veyne in swich licour
Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
[q]uit, or continue chatting: translate
When April with its sweet-smelling showers
Has pierced the drought of March to the root,
And bathed every vein (of the plants) in such liquid
By which strength the flower is created;
[q]uit, or continue chatting:
```

## Requirements
`Calais` requires an OpenAI API key that can run `GPT-4`. 

## Installation

Install the Python package using Pip:
```bash
$ pip install pycalais
```

`Calais` will need your OpenAI API key exported as an environment variable:

```bash
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-open-ai-key'
```


## Limitations

1. Shell interpolation

Note that on the command line, you can't use punctuation that would be
interpreted by the shell like apostrophes or question marks. If you want to use
this punctuation, enclose the string in quotes.

```text
$ ai what's the OS version
quote> ^C                      # It's continuing the quote started in "what's"
$ ai "what's the OS version?"  # Surrounding the prompt with quotes works...
Command: `sw_vers -productVersion`
[r]un,(e)xplain],(q)uit, or continue chatting:
14.2.1
```

Or just skip the punctuation. GPT-4 will likely understand.

```
$ ai whats the OS version
Command: `sw_vers -productVersion`
[r]un,(e)xplain],(q)uit, or continue chatting:
14.2.1
```

2. Complex Scripts
  
Although it uses a system prompt that instructs it to prefer generate runnable
commands, `GPT-4` sometimes returns scripts:


```text
$ ai automatically watch files for changes and turn unit tests, sending an email if they fail
To automatically watch files for changes, run unit tests, and send an email if
they fail, you can use a combination of shell scripting and tools like
`inotifywait` (for Linux) or `fswatch` (for macOS), along with your testing
framework and a command-line email tool like `sendmail` or `mail`. Since the OS
is Darwin, we'll use `fswatch`. This script is a basic example and might need
adjustments based on your specific testing framework and email setup:

#!/bin/bash

DIRECTORY_TO_WATCH='./your_project_directory'
TEST_COMMAND='your_test_command' # Replace with your specific test command
EMAIL='your_email@example.com'

fswatch -o $DIRECTORY_TO_WATCH | while read change; do
  $TEST_COMMAND
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo 'Tests failed, sending email.'
    echo 'Unit tests failed at $(date)' | mail -s 'Unit Test Failure' $EMAIL
  fi
done

1. Replace `./your_project_directory` with the path to the directory containing
   the files you want to watch.
2. Replace `your_test_command` with the command you use to run your unit tests.
3. Replace `your_email@example.com` with your email address.

Make sure you have `fswatch` installed (`brew install fswatch` if you're using
Homebrew). Also, ensure you have a mail server configured for sending emails
from the command line, or use a command-line email tool that supports your
email provider.
[q]uit, or continue chatting:
```

`Calais` does not try to save or run these scripts. You can copy these from the
output to run them.

3. GPT-4, like all current Large Language Models may hallucinate or make other
   errors. 
   
   Always review the returned command before running it.

## Safeties and Cautions

This program presents commands generated by GPT-4 for you to run. Unsafe
commands could be generated. Unsafe commands are those that could delete data,
cause your system to become unresponsive, or cause other problems. __Always review
the commands before running them.__

Two safety mechanisms are included:
1. GPT-4 is instructed not to return unsafe commands.
2. The program does simple checks for unsafe commands and inputs.

```
$ ai erase the disk
GPT-4 returned an error:
[unsafe command requested]
Exiting.
```

Unsafe commands could slip past these checks. These checks cannot prevent all
potentially unsafe commands from being generated or run. Do not use this program
on systems with sensitive or valuable data. Use at your own risk.

The primary risk mitigation is that commands are shown to you for confirmation
before they are run. Always review the commands before running them. 

Note that these simple safety checks may prevent the programs from generating 
commands that are actually safe to run.

## Code 

The code demonstrates the following features in working with the OpenAI API:
- Streaming Chat Completions so that the text is returned to the user as it is generated. 
- JSON output so that GPT-4 returns structured output.
- Streaming JSON extraction so that the user sees clean generated text, even though the text is embedded within JSON structures that have not yet completed.
- Retry and error handling so that network or other intermittent errors do not prevent a successful API call.

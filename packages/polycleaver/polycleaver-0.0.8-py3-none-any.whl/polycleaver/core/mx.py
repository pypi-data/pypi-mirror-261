    Generates non-polar, stoichiometric slabs from a given ionic crystal

    Args:
        bulk:       pymatgen.core.structure.Structure object of the bulk
                    of which slabs are to be generated.
        hkl:        list of Miller indices as tuples (e.g., [(0,0,1), (0,1,0)])
                    of planes parallel to surfaces to generate. Alternatively,
                    maximum integer of the Miller index to analyse (e.g., if hkl=1,
                    all symmetrically distinct Miller indices up to (1,1,1) will be
                    considered, as determined by pymatgen's
                    'get_symmetrically_distinct_miller_indices' function).
        thickness:  thickness of the preliminary slabs generated. Note that
                    this thickness will certainly vary in the final, corrected
                    slabs.
        vacuum:     vacuum of the preliminary slabs in the direction normal to
                    the surface. Note that this thickness will certainly vary
                    in the final, corrected slabs.

    Returns:
        (list): SlabUnit objects of corrected slabs with all required parameters
                for characterisation.

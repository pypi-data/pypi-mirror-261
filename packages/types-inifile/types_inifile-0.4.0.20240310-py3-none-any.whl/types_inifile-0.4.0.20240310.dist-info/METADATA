## Typing stubs for inifile

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`inifile`](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/python-inifile) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`inifile`.

This version of `types-inifile` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `inifile==0.4.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/inifile. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `f94bbfbcc4c3b2b289425ea793beda0822e702f8` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.350, and
pytype 2024.2.27.

The LocUCT package contains three parts: 
(1) annotation.py automatically recognizes coordinate types;
(2) geocoding. py Geocoding: converts textual location descriptions such as address and place names into latitude and longitude coordinates;
(3) transformation.py realizes the mutual conversion of different coordinate format types

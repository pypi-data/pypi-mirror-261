this function adds number to calculator memory (at start memory = 0):

```python
YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME.add(number)
```

### Subtraction

this function subtracts number to calculator memory (at start memory = 0):

```python
YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME.subtract(number)
```

### Multiplication

this function multiplies number to calculator memory (at first use memory = value, which was entered):

```python
YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME.multiply(number)
```

### Division

this function divides number to calculator memory (at first use memory = value, which was entered):

```python
YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME.divide(number)
```

### Nth root

this function takes nth root from number and stores result to memory:

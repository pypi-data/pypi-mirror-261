Description: # Lucy SPC
        
        Lucy SPC is a Python library inspired by the character Lucy Pevensie from the Narnia movie series. It provides functionalities to read and write .spc (Special Configuration) files, allowing easy conversion to and from JSON format.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install Lucy SPC via pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install lucy-spc
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Reading .spc Files
        
        ```python
        import lucy_spc as cf
        
        # Initialize Config object with the path to the .spc file
        spc = cf.Config("example.spc")
        
        # Read the .spc file and convert it to JSON format
        json_data = spc.readLucy()
        
        # Print the JSON data
        print(json_data)
        ```
        
        ### Modifying JSON Data
        
        ```python
        # Modify the JSON data as needed
        spc.jsonData["aws2"]["secret_key"] = "new_secret_key"
        
        # Write the modified JSON data back to the .spc file
        spc.writeLucy()
        ```
        
        ### Writing .spc Files
        
        ```python
        # Create a new JSON object with the desired configuration
        new_config = {
            "connection1": {
                "plugin": "aws",
                "secret_key": "my_secret_key",
                "access_key": "my_access_key",
                "regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
            },
            "connection2": {
                "plugin": "gcp",
                "secret_key": "another_secret_key",
                "access_key": "another_access_key",
                "regions": ["us-central1", "us-west1"]
            }
        }
        
        # Initialize Config object with a new .spc file path
        new_spc = cf.Config("new_config.spc")
        
        # Assign the new JSON data
        new_spc.jsonData = new_config
        
        # Write the JSON data to a new .spc file
        new_spc.writeLucy()
        ```

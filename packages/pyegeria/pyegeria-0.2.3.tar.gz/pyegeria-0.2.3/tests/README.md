# pyegeria: unit tests

This directory holds unit tests for pyegeria. The testing framework is **pytest**.
Each python file in the src/pyegeria directory has a corresponding unit test file in this directory.
The unit tests may be run individually or in batch - however there are some configuration 
dependencies that will influence the outcome of the tests. 

Currently, the sample servers and configurations leverage the [Egeria Project - Coco Pharmaceuticals Lab](https://egeria-project.org/education/egeria-dojo/running-egeria/coco-labs-environment)

notebooks and structure. One of the areas being developed is to move this to a simpler
configuration environment based on the pre-built sample configurations that Egeria ships with.
As this matures, additional testing setup instructions will follow.


This is a work in progress - so some volatility is to be expected.

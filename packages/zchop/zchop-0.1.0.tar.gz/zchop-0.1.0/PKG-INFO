# zchop

This is a python library providing the function `zchop`, which replaces numbers
that are close to zero with zero.

* `zchop` traverses structures such as `list`s and
  numpy `array`s, returning a copy that is the same as the input except that small numbers
  are set to zero.
* `zchop_mut` is a mutating version of `zchop` that mutates `list`s and
numpy `array`s.

# Comments

* The parts of complex numbers are treated separately.
* Non-numbers are passed unchanged.

## Antecedents

This package is based on the Julia package [ZChop.jl](https://github.com/jlapeyre/ZChop.jl), which is in turn based on the
Mathematica function [Chop](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Chop.html).

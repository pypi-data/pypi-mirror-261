to test development locally:

- make sure that you are at the root of the project directory (i.e. [`/pyproject.toml`](/pyproject.toml) is in your current directory)
- in your terminal, run:
  ```shell
  python -m src.fastdev
  ```
- open your web browser at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000)
- navigate to the `tests` directory, and open each file and check if it gets served as its compiled and bundled version

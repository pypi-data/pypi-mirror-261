# clikan: CLI (Personal) Kanban
There has been a little chatter about 'personal' kanban on the tubes lately.  I don't know about the need to hype it as personal, but if you're looking to get your head wrapped around stuff needing to get done - then kanban is a healthy tool.  clikan is a super simple command-line utility for tracking tasks following the Japanese Kanban (boarding) style.  clikan's core intent is to be easy to use, and to maintain simplicity.

## Installation

$ `pip install clikan`

### Alternative Installation with Guix

$ `guix install clikan`

### Create a `.clikan.yaml` in your $HOME directory

```yaml
---
clikan_data: /Users/kplummer/.clikan.dat
limits:
  todo: 10
  wip: 3
  done: 10
  taskname: 40
repaint: true
```

* `clikan_data` is the datastore file location.
* `limits:todo` is the max number of items allowed in the todo column, keep this small - you want a smart list, not an ice box of ideas here.
* `limits:wip` is the max number of items allowed in in-progress at a given time.  Context-switching is a farce, focus on one or two tasks at a time.
* `limits:done` is the max number of done items visible, they'll still be stored.  It's good to see a list of done items, for pure psyche.
* `limits:taskname` is the max length of a task text.
* `repaint` is used to tell `clikan` to show the display after every successful command - default is false/off.

-- or --

$ `clikan configure`

to create a default data file location.

This is where the tool will store the history of files.  It's configurable so you can put the data in a Dropbox or other cloud-watched directory for safe archiving/backing up.

If you're like me, even `clikan` is a bunch too many characters to type, so shorten with an alias in my shell config to `clik`.

## Usage
The basic usage of clikan breaks down into three basic commands:

### Show

$ `clikan show` (alias: s)

### Add

$ `clikan add [task text]` (alias: a)

### Promote

$ `clikan promote [task id]` (alias: p)

And there are more supporting commands:

### Regress

$ `clikan regress [task id]`

### Delete

$ `clikan delete [task id]` (alias: d)

### Configure

$ `clikan configure`

## Development

It's Python code.  Fork, fix, and submit a PR - it'd be super appreciated.

Tests?  Um, yeah.

### Testing

Updated test suite to include 3.6-3.9 on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu.

***Definitely*** need some help here.  There is a basic test suite available in `clikan_test.py`.

To run it, make sure ~/.clikan.dat is empty, or specify a test locale
with the `CLIKAN_HOME` environment variable the you can run:

```
CLIKAN_HOME=/tmp pytest clikan_test.py
```

The project uses this environment variable feature to test different functional configuration scenarios internally to the test suite.

Am considering adding the `--config_file` feature to allow for specifying the path to the config file as well.  If this is something you're interesting in or believe would be beneficial let me know through an Github issue.

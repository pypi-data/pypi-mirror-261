           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

**Xplainable** makes tabular machine learning transparent, fair, and actionable.
</div>

## Why Was Xplainable Created?
In machine learning, there has long been a trade-off between accuracy and 
explainability. This drawback has led to the creation of explainable ML
libraries such as [Shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and [Lime](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) which make estimations of model decision processes. These can be incredibly time-expensive and often present steep
learning curves making them challenging to implement effectively in production
environments.

To solve this problem, we created ``xplainable``. **xplainable** presents a
suite of novel machine learning algorithms specifically designed to match the
performance of popular black box models like [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) and [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM) while
providing complete transparency, all in real-time.

## Simple Interface
You can interface with xplainable either through a typical Pythonic API, or
using a notebook-embedded GUI in your Jupyter Notebook.

## Models
Xplainable has each of the fundamental tabular models used in data science
teams. They are fast, accurate, and easy to use.

<div align="center">

| Model | Python API| Jupyter GUI |
|:-----:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Regression | ✅ | ✅ |
| Binary Classification | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multi-Class Classification | ✅ | 🔜 |
</div>

## Installation

You can install the core features of ``xplainable`` with:

```
pip install xplainable
```

to use the ``xplainable`` gui in a jupyter notebook, install with:

```
pip install xplainable[gui]
```

- Visit our [General Documentation](https://docs.xplainable.io) to learn how to get the best out of xplainable
- Vist our [API Documentation](https://xplainable.readthedocs.io) for additional support with using our API

## Getting Started

**Basic Example**

```python
import xplainable as xp
from xplainable.core.models import XClassifier
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
data = xp.load_dataset('titanic')

X, y = data.drop(columns=['Survived']), data['Survived']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
     X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# Train a model
model = XClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Explain the model
model.explain()
```


## Features
Xplainable helps to streamline development processes by making model tuning
and deployment simpler than you can imagine.

### Preprocessing
We built a comprehensive suite of preprocessing transformers for rapid and
reproducible data preprocessing.

<div align="center">

|:------|:------:|:------:|
| Data Health Checks | ✅ | ✅ |
| Transformers Library | ✅ | ✅ |
| Preprocessing Pipelines | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pipeline Persistance | ✅ | ✅ |
</div>

#### Using the API
```python
from xplainable.preprocessing.pipeline import XPipeline
from xplainable.preprocessing import transformers as xtf

pipeline = XPipeline()

# Add stages for specific features
pipeline.add_stages([
    {"feature": "age", "transformer": xtf.Clip(lower=18, upper=99)},
    {"feature": "balance", "transformer": xtf.LogTransform()}
])

# add stages on multiple features
pipeline.add_stages([
    {"transformer": xtf.FillMissing({'job': 'mode', 'age': 'mean'})},
    {"transformer": xtf.DropCols(columns=['duration', 'campaign'])}
])

# Fit and transform the data
train_transformed = pipeline.fit_transform(train)

# Apply transformations on new data
test_transformed = pipeline.transform(test)

```


#### Using the GUI

```python
pp = xp.Preprocessor()

pp.preprocess(train)
```

from xplainable.core.models import XClassifier
from xplainable.core.optimisation.bayesian import XParamOptimiser
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
data = xp.load_dataset('titanic')

# note: the data requires preprocessing, so results may be poor
X, y = data.drop('Survived', axis=1), data['Survived']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Optimise params
opt = XParamOptimiser(metric='roc-auc')
params = opt.optimise(X_train, y_train)

# Train your model
model = XClassifier(**params)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Explain the model
model.explain()
```

#### Using the GUI

```python
model = xp.classifier(train)
```
<div align="center">

</div><br>


### Rapid Refitting
Fine tune your models by refitting model parameters on the fly, even on
individual features.

#### Using the API
```python
new_params = {
            "features": ['Age'],
            "max_depth": 6,
            "min_info_gain": 0.01,
            "min_leaf_size": 0.03,
            "weight": 0.05,
            "power_degree": 1,
            "sigmoid_exponent": 1,
            "x": X_train,
            "y": y_train
}

model.update_feature_params(**new_params)
```

We promote fair and ethical use of technology for all machine learning tasks.
To help encourage this, we're working on additional bias detection and fairness
testing classes to ensure that everything you deploy is safe, fair, and
compliant.

## Xplainable Cloud
This Python package is free and open-source. To add more value to data teams
within organisations, we also created Xplainable Cloud that brings your models
to a collaborative environment.

```python
import xplainable as xp
import os

xp.initialise(api_key=os.environ['XP_API_KEY'])
```

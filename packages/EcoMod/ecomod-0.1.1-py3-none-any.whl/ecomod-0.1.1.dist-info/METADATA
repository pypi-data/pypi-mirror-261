# EcoMod
Greetings, fellow ecologists. This is a simple species distribution modelling package, with currently only having the BIOCLIM function.

## installation
Use the package manager pip to install the module.
```bash
pip install EcoMod
```

## Usage
```python
import EcoMod

# get occurrences data & WorldClim GeoTiff
bioclims = [1, 12]
# # |: repeat for testing set
coordinates = EcoMod.get_coord("sp. name")
latitudes = [i[0] for i in coordinates]
longitudes = [i[1] for i in coordinates]
EcoMod.bioclimap(coordinates, bioclims, reso=10)
# # # [1] call to get the optimum from the training set.
EcoMod.get_norm_const(coordinates)
# # :| [2] normalise the prediction (i.e., testing, present) map
clusters = EcoMod.radius_cluster(coordinates, 2) # optional
normed_array = EcoMod.normalise()

# view the prediction map using matplotlib
# # assign 'extent_84320700' (variable) to the 'extent' param
# # to crop out the Region of Focus
...
plt.imshow(normed_array, extent=extent_84320700)
plt.show()
```

## Roadmap
I'll next be working on a more advance and statistically comprehensive feature like MaxEnt and its related target group background.
The aesthetic part of the map (i.e, visualisation) is also part of the roadmap.
This project is also following the guidelines and suggestions in Soley-Guardia et al.'s (2024) publication on the top ten hazards that were seen when modelling species distribution.

This eco-modelling package was inspired by Timothée Poisot's "BioClim from scratch" tutorial. Special thanks to Professor Poisot (@tpoisot) for creating such an informative guide on modelling the bioclimatic distribution of species.

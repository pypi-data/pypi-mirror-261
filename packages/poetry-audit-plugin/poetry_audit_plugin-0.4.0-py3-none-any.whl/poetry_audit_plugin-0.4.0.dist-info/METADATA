pipx inject poetry poetry-audit-plugin
```

Otherwise, if you used `pip` to install Poetry you can add the plugin packages via the `pip install` command.

```

## Available options

* `--json`: Export the result in JSON format.

* `--ignore-code`: Ignore some vulnerabilities IDs. Receive a list of IDs. For example:

```bash
poetry audit --ignore-code=CVE-2022-42969,CVE-2020-10684
```

* `--ignore-package`: Ignore some packages. Receive a list of packages. For example:

```bash
poetry audit --json --ignore-package=py,ansible-tower-cli
```

* `--proxy-protocol`, `--proxy-host`, `--proxy-port`: Proxy to access Safety DB. For example:

```bash
poetry audit --proxy-protocol=http --proxy-host=localhost --proxy-port=3128
```

* `--cache-sec`: How long Safety DB can be cached locally. For example:

```bash
poetry audit --cache-sec=60
```

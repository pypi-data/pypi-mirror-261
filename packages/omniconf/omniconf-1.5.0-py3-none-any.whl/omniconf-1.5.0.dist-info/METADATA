A Python library that makes configuring your application independent from your configuration backend.

Documentation
-------------

Read the complete documentation on `Read the Docs <http://omniconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Why omniconf?
-------------

Configuring applications is hard, and it doesn't help that there are many different (and valid) ways to do it:

* cli arguments
* config files: ConfigObj (.ini like), JSON, YAML, TOML
* environment variables

Each of this methods are a valid way to configure an application, and each have their own strengths. Cli arguments are
most suited for tools and daemons. Configuration files are suited for applications that have more complex requirements.
Environment variables and key/value stores are handy when using containers. You may even want to use a combination of
methods (not yet implemented).

This library aims to make configuring the application easier, and allows you to use multiple configuration backends
transparently.

For up-to-date examples, take a look `here <http://omniconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_.

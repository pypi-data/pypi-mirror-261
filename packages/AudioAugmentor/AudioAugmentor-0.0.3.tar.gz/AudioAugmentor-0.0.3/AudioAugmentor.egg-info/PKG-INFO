# AudioAugmentor
### Python library for augmenting audio data
This library is designed to augment audio data for machine learning purposes. 
It combines several tools and libraries for audio data augmentation and provides unified interface which can be used to apply large set of audio augmentations in one place.

The library is designed to be used with the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) machine learning framework.
It can also work solely on just simple audio waveforms and augment those.

This library specifically combines theese libraries and tools:

- [torchaudio](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/index.html)
- [audiomentations](https://github.com/iver56/audiomentations)
- [torch-audiomentations](https://github.com/asteroid-team/torch-audiomentations)
- [pyroomacoustics](https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics)
- [ffmpeg-python](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python)



Table below shows which library was used to apply specific audio augmentation/codec.

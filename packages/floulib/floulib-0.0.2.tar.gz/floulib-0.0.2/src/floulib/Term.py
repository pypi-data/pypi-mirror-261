    This class contains methods to define and use a term for
    linguistic variable, especially for rules in fuzzy controller.
    In general, a term is the association of a string like "small" 
    and its meaning, i.e. the membership function associated with 
    the term.
    
    In special cases, variable may contain purely linguistic terms
    which have no meaning associated with.

        Term is a subclass of :class:`Plot`, therefore all methods in :class:`Plot`

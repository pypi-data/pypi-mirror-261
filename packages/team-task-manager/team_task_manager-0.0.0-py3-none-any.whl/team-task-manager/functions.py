'''This module primarily contains the functions that allow a simple team task
management program to work.
--------------------
Functions:

    Recurrent:

        semicolon_found(*args) -> string, bool:
            Checks if arguments include semicolon.
        character_exceed(*args) -> strings, bool:

        add_task: Adds a new task onto the system.

    Viewing/modifying:

        view_all_tasks(current_user): Displays all tasks on the system to the
            console.

            task managing options. Admin only.
        mark_complete(t_choice, all_t_index): Changes whether a task is or
            isn't complete. Admin only.

            assigned to. Admin only.
        change_date(t_choice, all_t_index): Changes the due date of a tasks.
            Admin only.

        view_my_tasks(current_user): Displays all tasks on the system assigned
            to the current user to the console.
        vm_manage_t(t_choice, index_dict, all_t_index): Displays a chosen task
            and presents task managing options.
        vm_mark_complete(t_choice, index_dict, all_t_index): Changes whether a
            task is or isn't complete.

            that a task is assigned to.
        vm_change_date(t_choice, index_dict, all_t_index): Changes the due date
            of a tasks.

    Summary:

        generate_report: Generates a task overview and user overview file.
            Admin only. 
        disp_stats: Displays an overview of all tasks and users to the console.
            Admin only.

    Modifying login:
        edit_profile(current_user, current_pass): Presents the login editing
            options.
        edit_name(current_user, current_pass): Changes the user's username.
        edit_pass(current_user): Changes the user's password.

--------------------
users.txt
--------------------
This file is integral to the the functioning of the program.
User login credentials are stored in the users.txt file.
users.txt will be created on program launch if the file doesn't already exist.
The file by default includes the string 'admin;password' serving as the admin
credentials.

User credentials are read line by line.
Each line represents a user, and includes their username and password separated
by a ';'. 
It's important to note that because users.txt uses ';' to separate components,
semicolons can't be included in usernames or passwords.  

--------------------
tasks.txt
--------------------
This file is integral to the the functioning of the program.
Tasks information are stored in the tasks.txt file.
tasks.txt will be created on program launch if the file doesn't already exist.
The file will be empty by default.

Tasks are read line by line.
Each line represents a task, and includes:
  - The name of the user the task is assigned to
  - Task title
  - Task description
  - Task due date
  - The date and time assigned
  - Whether the task is complete
  - Whether the task is overdue
    
These task components are separated by ';'.
Because tasks.txt uses ';' to separate task components, semicolons can't be
included in any task components.

--------------------
task_overview.txt
--------------------
This file displays an overview of all tasks in tasks.txt, and is
generated/rewritten when generate_report is called by the admin. 

Displays:
    - The total number of task
    - The number of completed tasks
    - The number of incomplete and overdue tasks
    - The percentage of incomplete tasks
    - The percentage of overdue tasks

--------------------
user_overview.txt
--------------------
This file displays an overview of all users in users.txt and the tasks 
assigned to them in tasks.txt, and is generated/rewritten when generate_report
is called by the admin. 

Displays:
    - The number of users
    - The number of tasks generated and tracked
    - The following information per user:
        - Username
        - Number of tasks
        - Percentage of all tasks assigned to this user
        - Percentage of tasks completed
        - Percentage of tasks incomplete
        - Percentage of tasks incomplete and overdue

--------------------
Constant variables
--------------------
After the datetime module is imported, the chosen date format throughout the
program is "%Y-%m-%d,%H:%M".

2:00 p.m. on the 29th of February 2024 would be formatted as: 2024-02-29,14:00

--------------------
Language notes
--------------------
- The use of 't' in this document is short for 'task'.
- 'curr' is short for 'current'.
- 'dt' is short for 'datetime'.
- 'u' is short for 'user'.
- 'vm' is short for 'view my'.
- 'disp' is short for 'display'.
- 'oview' is short for 'overview'.
- 'per' is short for 'percent'.

    If any of the above criteria are not met the user is notified this and

    If the above criteria are met, the new username replaces the old username

    username change and be assigned to the new username.

    The user is notified that their username has been changed and that the

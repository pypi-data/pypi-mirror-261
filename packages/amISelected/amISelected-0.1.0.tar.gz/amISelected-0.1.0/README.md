# Am I Selected?

Well are you?

After installing it with pip:

```shell
pip install amISelected
```

You can run the following command to get an email when your status changed in the [coudert webpage](https://www.coudert.name/concours_cnrs_2023.html):

```shell
amISelected --name lastname firstname \
            --year 2023 \
            --username your_username \
            --smtp smtp.your.server.com \
            --port 587 \
            --recipient you@mail.com \
```

Your `smtp` password will be then asked (leave empty if you don't want to recieve emails).

It looks a bit fishy because it is ... But I don't know how to do otherwise

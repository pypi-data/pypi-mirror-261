Description: ****
        Wilt
        ****
        The simplest possible code metric::
        
           W Whitespace
           I Integrated over
           L Lines of
           T Text
        
        An implementation of WILT from a great talk by Robert Smallshire called
        Confronting Complexity [1]_ [2]_. In the talk there were quite a few other
        visualisations that inspire development this package.
        
        Install with::
        
           pipx install Wilt
        
        The metric can be calculated like::
        
          $ wilt /usr/lib/python3.12/unittest/case.py
          2677.75
        
          $ wilt '/usr/lib/python3.12/**/*.py'
          346219.0
        
          $ echo "    foo" | wilt -i 2 -
          2.0

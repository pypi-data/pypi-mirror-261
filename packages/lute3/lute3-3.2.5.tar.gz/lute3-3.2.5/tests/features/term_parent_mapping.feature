Feature: Term import
    Valid files are imported

    Background:
        Given demo data
        And language Spanish

    # The scenarios here use parent term 'dog' and child term 'dogs',
    # as documented in the manual.
    # https://jzohrab.github.io/lute-manual/usage/terms/parent-terms-bulk-mapping.html
    # The manual is actually slightly out of date (Nov 2023), as Lute now supports
    # multiple parents.

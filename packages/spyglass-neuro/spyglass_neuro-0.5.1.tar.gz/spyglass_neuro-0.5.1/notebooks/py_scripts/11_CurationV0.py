# # Curation
#

# ## Overview
#

# _Developer Note:_ if you may make a PR in the future, be sure to copy this
# notebook, and use the `gitignore` prefix `temp` to avoid future conflicts.
#
# This is one notebook in a multi-part series on Spyglass.
#
# - To set up your Spyglass environment and database, see
#   [this notebook](./00_Setup.ipynb)
# - For a more detailed introduction to DataJoint with inserts, see
#   [this notebook](./01_Insert_Data.ipynb)
# - [The Spike Sorting notebook](./10_Spike_SortingV0.ipynb) is a mandatory
#   prerequisite to Curation.
#

# ## Spikes Sorted
#
# Let's check that the sorting was successful in the previous notebook.
#

# Define the name of the file that you copied and renamed from previous tutorials
nwb_file_name = "minirec20230622.nwb"

# ## `sortingview` web app
#

# As of June 2021, members of the Frank Lab can use the `sortingview` web app for
# manual curation.

# ERROR: curation_feed_uri not a field in SpikeSorting

# This will take you to a workspace on the `sortingview` app. The workspace, which
# you can think of as a list of recording and associated sorting objects, was
# created at the end of spike sorting. On the workspace view, you will see a set
# of recordings that have been added to the workspace.
#
# ![Workspace view](./../notebook-images/workspace.png)
#
# Clicking on a recording then takes you to a page that gives you information
# about the recording as well as the associated sorting objects.
#
# ![Recording view](./../notebook-images/recording.png)
#
# Click on a sorting to see the curation view. Try exploring the many
# visualization widgets.
#
# ![Unit table](./../notebook-images/unittable.png)
#
# The most important is the `Units Table` and the `Curation` menu, which allows
# you to give labels to the units. The curation labels will persist even if you
# suddenly lose connection to the app; this is because the curation actions are
# appended to the workspace as soon as they are created. Note that if you are not
# logged in with your Google account, `Curation` menu may not be visible. Log in
# and refresh the page to access this feature.

# ## Up Next
#
# Next, we'll turn our attention to [LFP data](./12_LFP.ipynb) data.

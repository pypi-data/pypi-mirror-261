### What is Guanaco?
Guanaco is a library designed to help anyone get into machine learning in the stock market.
All you have to do is connect some APIs, and boom -- Guanaco does the rest!
### How do I use it?
Check out the [main example](example.py) to get started!
### What the heck is that name?
Well, Alpaca and LLAMA were both taken by projects related to this one; so, I decided on their long-lost cousin -- [the guanaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanaco)!
I found it quite fitting how both the library and the animal are closely related to their respective families, yet both quite unknown by the general public.

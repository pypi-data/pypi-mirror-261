# Waffle CLI

Waffle enables one deploy a secrure foundation, and hosting for webapplications' backend and frontend components in AWS.

A few of the core principles of Waffle:
- Enable kicking off projects in a matter of few minutes.
- Secure infrastructure that enable best practices for application security.
- SOC II audit ready.
- Open source infrastructure as code. You only pay for your own hosting (requires AWS).
- No locking in. If your project's scope grows larger than what Waffle provides then you can easily add your custom components or modify Waffle's open source templates as needed.

This ngstents package is a c++ extension of the NGSolve finite element library, designed to ease experimentation with solvers based on spacetime tents for hyperbolic systems. A python front-end allows new equations (linear or nonlinear conservation laws) to be solved by easily defining required fluxes and numerical fluxes in a few lines of code.

Explanation. Clarification and discussion of key topics.

Hatch Jupyter Builder is a plugin for the ``hatchling`` Python build backend.
It is primarily targeted for package authors who are providing JavaScript
as part of their Python packages.

Typical use cases are Jupyter Lab Extensions and Jupyter Widgets.

The ``hatchling`` build backend is part of the `hatch <https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/intro/>`_ project,
a member of the Python Packaging Authority.  It provides a simple
build backend that is compliant with the relevant Python Enhancement
Proposals, but also provides many useful features such as
`shared-data <https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/plugins/builder/wheel/#options>`_, which can be used to provide Jupyter configuration
and runtime files.

Acknowledgements
================

We developed this code when working in the Pavan group,
https://www.gmpavanlab.com/, whose members often provide very valuable
feedback, which we gratefully acknowledge.

Much of the original code in ``cpctools`` was written by Daniele Rapetti (Iximiel).

The work was funded by the European Union and ERC under projects DYNAPOL and the
NextGenerationEU project, CAGEX.

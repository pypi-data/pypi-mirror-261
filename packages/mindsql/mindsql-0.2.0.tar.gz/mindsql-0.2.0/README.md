# üß† MindSQL

MindSQL is a Python RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Library designed to streamline the interaction between users and their databases using just a few lines of code. With seamless integration for renowned databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, MindSQL also extends its capabilities to major databases like Snowflake and BigQuery by extending the `IDatabase` Interface. This library utilizes large language models (LLM) like GPT-4, Llama 2, Google Gemini, and supports knowledge bases like ChromaDB and Faiss.

# Create MindSQLCore Instance With Configured Llm, Vectorstore, And Database
minds = MindSQLCore(
    llm=GoogleGenAi(config=config),
    vectorstore=ChromaDB(),
    database=Sqlite()
)

# Create a Database Connection Using The Specified URL
connection = minds.database.create_connection(url="YOUR_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL")

# Index All Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements in The Specified Database Into The Vectorstore
minds.index_all_ddls(connection=connection, db_name='NAME_OF_THE_DB')

# Index Question-Sql Pair in Bulk From the Specified Example Path
minds.index(bulk=True, path="your-qsn-sql-example.json")

# Ask a Question to The Database And Visualize The Result

# How to contribute

If you have ideas or code to contribute, please first open an [issue](https://github.com/oncoray/mirp/issues). We will then discuss your ideas and create an implementation roadmap.

Please keep the following in mind when contributiing:

- The main branch of `mirp` is protected. You can therefore make a pull request for your contribution to a development branch of the intended future version.
- If you introduce new functionality, this functionality should be tested as part of the tests in `test`.
- Code is styled according to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Function, class and method documentation is done using Numpy-flavoured [docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
  [Long-form documentation](https://oncoray.github.io/mirp/) is partially created from function, class and method documention, embedded in restructured text files in `docs_source`.

# rbf-lang

[Reversible BitFuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Reversible_Bitfuck) (RBF) is a [reversible Turing tarpit](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/22128/reversible-turing-tarpits) programming language. It is based on a tape of bits and has 5 commands:

 `*` Toggle the current bit
 `>` Shift the tape head right
 `<` Shift the tape head left
 `(` If the current bit is zero, jump past matching `)`
 `)` If the current bit is zero, jump to just after matching `(`

Here is an example program operating on 3 bits. Bit 0 is the source bit (`x`), bit 1 is the target bit (`y`) and bit 2 is the temporary bit (`f`). Here the value of `x` is being moved to `y`.

```
# x=?, y=0, f=0
(>>*<<) # set f if x is set
>>( # if f is set
    <(>*<)* # set y
    <*(>>*<<) # unset x
>>)
<(>*<) # if y is set, unset f
```

we can run the above program on an example tape (`100`) with rbf cli:

```sh
rbf -t "100" "(>>*<<)>>(<(>*<)*<*(>>*<<)>>)<(>*<)"  # outputs 010
```

## installation

RBF can be installed from source with

```sh
pip install .
```

or from pypi with

```sh
pip install rbf-lang
```

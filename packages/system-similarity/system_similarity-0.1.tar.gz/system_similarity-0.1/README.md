Article Recommendation Submodule
Overview
The Article Recommendation submodule focuses on recommending articles similar to a given target article. It employs OpenAI modules to generate vectors, numpy and pandas for data manipulation, and advanced similarity calculations for accurate results.

Workflow
Vector Generation:

The target article is passed through the OpenAI module to generate a vector representation.
The vector is then saved in the cache for future use, enhancing system performance.
Data Cleaning:

Utilizing numpy and pandas, the system cleans the data obtained from the CSV file, which includes article titles and descriptions.
Vectorization:

All article descriptions are converted into vectors using the OpenAI module, creating a numerical representation of each article.
Similarity Calculation:

The system calculates the similarity between the vector of the target article and the vectors of all other articles.
Recommendation:

Based on the similarity scores, the system recommends articles with the highest similarity to the target article.
 offers a seamless and efficient solution for article recommendation, providing fast, secure, and highly accurate results.

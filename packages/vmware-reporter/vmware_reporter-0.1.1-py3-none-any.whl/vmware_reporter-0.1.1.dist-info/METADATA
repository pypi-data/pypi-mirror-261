[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/vmware-reporter/badge/?version=latest)](https://vmware-reporter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Installation

Package `vmware-reporter` is [available on PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/project/vmware-reporter/):

```sh
pip install vmware-reporter
```


## Usage

VMWare Reporter may be used as a library in your Python code:

```py
from vmware_reporter import VCenterClient
with VCenterClient() as vcenter:
    for vm in vcenter.iterate_objs('vm'):
        print(vm.name)
```

It may also be invoked as a command-line application (`vmware-reporter` executable is installed with the package). Examples:

- Export inventory of VMWare managed objects to a YAML file:

```sh
vmware-reporter inventory
```

- Export all available information about VMWare managed objects to JSON files:

```sh
vmware-reporter dump
```

Complete help about command-line usage may be displayed by typing:

```sh
vmware-reporter --help
```

## Docs 

Docs are available in the [**wiki**](https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp/wiki) section on GitHub.

## Why choose this library?

The main reason why I decided to fork the original library is that it uses an old version of the API and doesn't support many features.

In this library I added app events (to listen to incoming messages) and implemented an easier way to send/receive messages and media by creating the `Message`object.

I fixed some bugs and added some features, but the library still needs a lot of work to be done even if it's working and usable.

## Installation

To install the library you can either use pip (latest release version):

``pip install whatsapp-python``

or git (latest development version):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp.git
cd whatsapp
python3 setup.py install
```

## Obtaining the WhatsApp API credentials

To use the WhatsApp API you need to create a Facebook Business account and a WhatsApp Business account.

**To create an account, I recomend to follow [this video](https://youtu.be/d6lNxP2gadA?si=_hbis7aP7MoKkck0)**

## Costs of the API

While using third-party API providers of the WhatsApp API may have some monthly fees, using the WhatsApp API provided directly by Facebook is way cheaper, even if the billing docs are pretty hard to understand.
The first 1000 chats created are free, then there is a pay-as-you-go fee that is paid for each conversation started.

**IMPORTANT**: it is now mandatory (at least it was for me) to add a credit card to the whatsapp account to use the service. I eventually got billed for using a non-test number (~1,20â‚¬), so be carefull using the API! I'm not responsible for any costs you may have using the API. 

A suggestion I can give you is to use a test number (you can get one for free and use it for testing purposes only).

All the prices are available in the [**WhatsApp API docs**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing)

## Switching from `Neurotech-HQ/heyoo`
*You can ignore this if it's your first time using the library.*
Any version >1.1.2 is incompatible with the original `heyoo` library! Be careful updating! Read the docs first!
Any version <=1.1.2 is fully compatible with the original `heyoo` library and doesn't include any breaking change..

Switching from heyoo to whatsapp-python doesn't require any change for versions up to 1.1.2: just uninstall `heyoo`, install `whatsapp-python==1.1.2` and change the import name from `heyoo` to `whatsapp`.
For version which are GREATER THEN 1.1.2, messages have became objects, so you need to change your code to use the new methods.

**Note**: docs for version 1.1.2 are available in the [**dedicated wiki page**](https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp/wiki/v1.1.2).

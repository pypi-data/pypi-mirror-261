# Idegrity IDentity Product Python Wrapper

This library provides a wrapper to access Idegrity's IDentity services

## Features

- Easy authentication
- Handles both image streams and image file
- Provides results in JSON or TOML

## Installation

Install this package with pip:

```
pip install idegrity-identity
```

## Usage

This library provides both synchronous and asynchronous clients to interact with the VerifyAPI. Here's how you can use each of them.

### Synchronous Usage

The synchronous version of the API can be used in scripts where asynchronous programming is not a requirement. Here's an example of how to use it:

```py
from idegrity_identity import IdentityAPI

# Initialize the API client with your credentials
identity_api = IdentityAPI(user_id=123, key="your_api_key", key_secret="your_api_secret")

# Use the client to upload images
try:
    response = identity_api.verify_images("path/to/id_image.png", "path/to/face_image.png")
    print(response)  # Process the response
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Asynchronous Usage

The asynchronous client is suitable for applications that are designed to take advantage of asynchronous programming, making your I/O-bound tasks more efficient. Here's how to use the asynchronous client:

```py
from idegrity_identity import AsyncIdentityAPI
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Initialize the API client with your credentials
    async_identity_api = AsyncIdentityAPI(user_id=123, key="your_api_key", key_secret="your_api_secret")
    # async_identity_api = AsyncIdentityAPI(user_id=123, key="your_api_key", key_secret="your_api_secret", endpoint_url="https://customurl.local") # optionally provide a custom API endpoint
    
    # Use the client to asynchronously upload images
    try:
        response = await async_identity_api.verify_images("path/to/id_image.png", "path/to/face_image.png")
        print(response)  # Process the response
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Run the async main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Handling File-Like Objects

Both synchronous and asynchronous clients support uploading images from file-like objects(streams) (e.g., **io.BytesIO**). Here's how you can do it:

```py
from idegrity_identity import IdentityAPI
from io import BytesIO

# Imagine these are your image bytes
id_image_bytes = b'...'
face_image_bytes = b'...'

# Convert bytes to file-like objects
id_image_file = BytesIO(id_image_bytes)
face_image_file = BytesIO(face_image_bytes)

# Initialize the API client with your credentials
identity_api = IdentityAPI(user_id=123, key="your_api_key", key_secret="your_api_secret")

# Upload the images
response = identity_api.verify_images(id_image_file, face_image_file)
print(response)
```

# Aineko

Aineko is a Python framework for building data applications.

With Aineko, you seamlessly bring data into any product and iterate quickly. Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Aineko helps you rapidly build scalable, maintainable, and fast data applications.

Under the hood, Aineko automatically configures tooling needed for production-ready data apps, like message brokers, distributed compute, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration and infrastructure.

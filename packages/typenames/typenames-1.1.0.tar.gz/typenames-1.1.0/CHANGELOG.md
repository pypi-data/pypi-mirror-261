# Changelog

## v1.1.0 (2024-03-08)

- Changed `REMOVE_ALL_MODULES`'s regex pattern to also remove `<locals>` from rendered output. `<locals>` typically appears in a type's qualified name if the type was defined within the local scope of a function or class method. ([PR #4](https://github.com/jayqi/typenames/pull/4))
- Removed support for Python 3.7. ([PR #5](https://github.com/jayqi/typenames/pull/5))
- Deprecated `LITERAL_TYPE_SUPPORTED` flag, since typenames no longer supports Python versions where this is false. ([PR #5](https://github.com/jayqi/typenames/pull/5))

## v1.0.0 (2023-02-20)

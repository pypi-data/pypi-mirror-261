A match making algorithm
------------------------

The roach case is a match making algorithm to create balanced teams from players
with different skills. It has two purposes:

* Iteratively score player's skill level based on the outcome of played
  matches.

* Use the player's latest scores to create balanced teams.


Scores are converted into *roaches* each players has in the *roach case*. *Roaches*
are traded after each match, depending on the outcome.

It is inspired by the `ELO scoring system`_ used in chess and other games.

A Python package
----------------

This Python package contains the *business logic* of the match making
algorithm, together with a very simple *command line interface* and simple
persistence layers. Other components can use it and extend it with a different
interface (web, standalone, ...) and more scalable persistence (local or cloud
database). Design is heavily inspired by `Clean Architecture`_ and/or `Onion
Architecture`_.

# CountEst

CountEst is a Python module containing the implementation of count-based estimators, i.e., supervised learning algorithms that make predictions based on the frequency or count of specific events, categories, or values within a dataset. These estimators operate under the assumption that the distribution of counts or frequencies provides valuable information for making predictions or inferences.

Currently, we have implemented count-based classifier for categorical data. It operates by learning the distribution of category counts (i.e. the number of occurrences or frequency of each distinct category within a specific feature) within each class during the training phase. It then predicts class probabilities for unseen data based on the observed counts of categories within each feature, employing a voting mechanism to handle ties.

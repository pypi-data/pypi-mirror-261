## How to set up with CLI

* Copy `template_secret.json` to `package/config/secret.json`
* Edit secret accordingly to json format and your credentials
* **Now you can use cli commands**

For Tunnelblick you must install tunnelblickctl

on macOS use:

```
brew tap benwebber/tunnelblickctl
brew install tunnelblickctl
```

_(ignore / delete windows requirements pywin32 & wexpect if
  your pip is trying to install them)_
* Copy `template_secret.json` to `package/config/secret.json`
* **Edit secret accordingly to json format and your credentials**

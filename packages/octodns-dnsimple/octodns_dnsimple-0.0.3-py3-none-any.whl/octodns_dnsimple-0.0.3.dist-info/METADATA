    # API v2 account access token (required)
    token: letmein

### Support Information

#### Records

All octoDNS record types are supported, there are some restrictions on CAA tags.

#### Dynamic

DnsimpleProvider does not support dynamic records.

### Development

See the [/script/](/script/) directory for some tools to help with the development process. They generally follow the [Script to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern. Most useful is `./script/bootstrap` which will create a venv and install both the runtime and development related requirements. It will also hook up a pre-commit hook that covers most of what's run by CI.

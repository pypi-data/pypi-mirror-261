nmrpeaklists
============

A Python library for handling NMR peak lists.

Read, write, process and convert between NMR peak list formats. Easily add and remove columns for data processing and fitting with NMRPipe. Sort and filter peak lists by the peak assignments. Currently supports peak lists from NMRPipe & Sparky and can read peak lists in XEASY and UPL formats.

Currently in final testing. Documentation and tutorial in progress [here](https://bradleyharden.github.io/nmrpeaklists/)

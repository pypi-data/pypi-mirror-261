Basic Image Preprocessing is a Python package that is focused on handling the various Image enhancement
and Noise removal techniques.

The package encompasses most of the basic methods and algorithms used for enhancing the quality 
of the image as well as the removal of noise from the image.


## Quick Install

You can install the package directly by using the pip command or through the conda command prompt

`pip install basic_image_preprocessing`
or
`conda install basic_image_preprocessing -c conda-forge`
